### Professional Assessment
<text> This project was incredibly insightful and helped show me new avenues on web-development and creating content that is visible on the internet. I utilized github pages over Heroku which is what I am more normally used to. This didnâ€™t come without challenges, as there seems to be problems with my database connection. This could be for one of a few reasons. One in particular is that github pages is good for hosting content without a backend. My application does have a backend server which makes Heroku a better hosting site because it will host the server as well.
	
	The fact that I know this information now shows how far I have come in the last eight weeks. My final product may not look like much, however it has come a long way from an application that simply stores information locally. This connects to a MySQL database. There was some front-end color schemes that got lost in translation, but this is to be expected and can be remedied easily. 
	
	Github is such an invaluable tool when it comes to collaborating in a team environment. It allows developers to have a single source to push and pull from and work within providing a hub (no pun intended) where they can centralize their work. This can even be used to communicate progress to stakeholders as they can easily be given access to the project repositories. 
	
	Again, the front-end of my project may not look like much but that is because I am not exactly too sharp on front-end development. I pride myself on the back-end and I have created a RESTful API and a simple server for my To-Do application that utilizes MySQL database hosted on the cloud. I demonstrated my ability to create good code that is readable to others in a collaborative environment. One thing that I would say I need to focus more on while moving forward is security. My application is functioning, now I need to harden the server and the system itself to make it immune to code injections and other vulnerabilities. 
	Since I chose one artifact, it is easy to see how it fits together. I started with a simple application that had a simple .html file for the front end. I reconfigured the entire application to have a frontend, and a backend. Within the backend is a simple server that queries a database. Altogether, this application demonstrates the construction of a basic, yet functioning web application barring the cloud database connectivity. For proof of concept, a local database can be used instead to demonstrate functionality. </text>
